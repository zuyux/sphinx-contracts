    "question": "Given the recent developments in quantum computing, what strategies should be adopted to ensure data security and prevent vulnerabilities in classical encryption methods?",
    "context": "Quantum computing is evolving rapidly, with quantum computers capable of solving certain types of problems much faster than classical computers. This poses a significant threat to classical encryption methods like RSA, ECC, and other public-key cryptography algorithms currently used to secure sensitive data. The quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm, could effectively break many cryptographic protocols if large-scale quantum computers become a reality. To mitigate this risk, there is an increasing focus on developing 'quantum-resistant' encryption standards. Strategies may include transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, ensuring critical infrastructure upgrades, and considering hybrid cryptographic methods that combine classical and quantum-resistant elements."
