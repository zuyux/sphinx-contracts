    "question": "In light of the recent emission of a powerful X9.0-class solar flare captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, what protective protocols should be in place for energy and technological infrastructures against future extreme solar events?",
    "context": "These types of extreme solar events can cause geomagnetic storms that affect Earth's magnetic field, disrupting radio communications, GPS navigation systems, and causing fluctuations in power grids. The charged particles released by the flare can induce geomagnetically induced currents in high-voltage lines, transformers, and electrical equipment, leading to permanent damage and regional blackouts. Additionally, satellites and space stations are also at risk, as intense radiation can damage their electronic components and alter their orbit."
